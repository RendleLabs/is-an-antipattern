Lately it's become fashionable to create repositories that delegate to {thing} in an attempt to decouple the consuming code, while still getting some of the other {thing} productivity benefits.
This breaks down really badly when you need to work with relationships.
This is fundamental to how {thing} works.
This is a fundamentally flawed, leaky abstraction.
For this reason alone, I consider an {thing}-backed repository to be the worst of both worlds, not a convenient middleground.
